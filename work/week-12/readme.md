- I worked on revamping existing the prosoul with grimoirelab doc and updated it with the latest workflow :sparkles: ([Bitergia/prosoul#216](https://github.com/Bitergia/prosoul/pull/216)), and also updated the repository with the latest docker-compose file ([Bitergia/prosoul#215](https://github.com/Bitergia/prosoul/pull/215)) and latest images ([Bitergia/prosoul#213](https://github.com/Bitergia/prosoul/pull/213)) too. Thanks to Valerio, who helped me with designing them.
- I submitted a PR to sirmordred repo, adding the configurations and documentation of the enrichers. [chaoss/grimoirelab-sirmordred#486](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-sirmordred/pull/486)
