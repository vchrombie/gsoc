- Also, I have opened an issue for discussions to add more quality models using the metrics extracted from different data sources during the project. If you are interested, please drop your suggestions on the issue thread. [vchrombie/gsoc#16](https://github.com/vchrombie/gsoc/issues/16)
- I worked on making a talk proposal about Prosoul so that I can apply for a few conferences. I made a presentation for the same purpose.
- I started working on the [GitLab.org](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org) pilot study. :small_airplane:
- I'm planning to complete the tests and the pilot study this week.
