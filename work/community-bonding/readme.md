## Community Bonding Period Work

### Week-1 Summary

> I was supposed to setup the project-tracker, fix a schedule for blogging & writing reports and setup the communication 
medium with the community and mentors.

- We will be discussing about the progress of this project every week at the `#grimoirelab` channel on freenode IRC 
(scheduled for every Thursday 17h to 18h (CEST) or 20h30 to 21h30 (IST)). The transcripts of the meetings (chats) will be 
uploaded to the project-tracker.
- I decided to write a work report and a blog post every week (mostly on Monday) explaning the work I did over the week. The 
blog posts will be on my [blog](https://vchrombie.github.io/blog).
- I created a project tracker, [vchrombie/gsoc](https://github.com/vchrombie/gsoc), where I will be storing the work reports, 
meeting logs, blog posts and almost everything related to the GSoC project. :tada:
  - You can find the meeting logs in the [meetings](https://github.com/vchrombie/gsoc/blob/master/meetings) directory.
  - You can find the work reports in the [work](https://github.com/vchrombie/gsoc/blob/master/work) directory.
  - You can find the blog posts on the README.md, [weekly updates](https://github.com/vchrombie/gsoc#weekly-updates).
- I created an issue in the governance repository to keep the community updated with my work, 
[chaoss/governance#205](https://github.com/chaoss/governance/issues/205). I will be posting the blog posts, meeting logs and 
work reports over there. :rocket:
- I will be sending the work summary with the blog links the CHAOSS and GrimoireLab mailing list.
