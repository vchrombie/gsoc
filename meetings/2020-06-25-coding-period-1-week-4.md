We had an online video call meeting this week. I had to show the progress and working demo of the project. I couldn't get the call on record.

I couldn't complete the demo due to some technical issues at the last moment. I'm planning to make a video demo on the work done until now. I'll mostly complete it by next weekend and upload it to YouTube. 
I showed the improvements in the dashboards and also performed assessments taking a couple of gitlab projects.

Things to be done in the coming weeks discussed in the meeting:
1. work on the tests of the completed enrichers
2. work on the _pipermailqm_ enricher
3. select an organization (gitlab.org, chaoss or any other) and make a QM perform prosoul tests on the projects
4. show the results as well as the dashboards to the community
